# AndroidOpenGL

An extremely simple Android app that implements a `GLSurfaceView` and uses OpenGL ES to draw some shapes. 

Based on https://developer.android.com/training/graphics/opengl

As the documentation per the above link does not include any code samples that can be directly
run in Android Studio, this project provides such a sample, with the intention of saving you
some time working around the quirks of setting up OpenGL.

Happy coding!
